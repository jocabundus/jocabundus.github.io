                        <h3>Rooted in a dark past, toads and frogs live far apart.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Toads thrive on the surface of the earth. Meanwhile, frogs struggle to survive 300 miles up, orbiting the globe from outer space.
                            They've been up there a long time, and they've had enough! They're going to storm the planet's surface and take back their land!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Seemingly valiant, indeed, the frogs could very well be the heroes of this story, if it wasn't for their leader, King Baxter,
                            a rancorous frog who also wants to wipe all toads off the face of the planet and out of existence.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Homeland under attack!</h3>
                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, on a small farm in the archipelago, Smokey is about to begin a day of torching weeds.
                            No sooner than strapping on his equipment does he find himself caught in the middle of the invasion.
                            Fortunately, his flame-throwing weed burner proves to be an effective weapon against the enemy,
                            and he springs into action to save his world (and kind)!
